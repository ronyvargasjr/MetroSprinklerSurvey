Metro Sprinkler Surveys — demo site

This is a small static demo that implements:
- Left-side vertical navigation carousel
- Centered vertical sections carousel (Home / About / Projects / Contact)
- Synced scrolling between nav and sections
- Color palette inspired by the provided image (dark greys + warm orange gradient)

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with...).
2. Use the left nav (or mouse wheel / keyboard arrows / touch swipe) to change sections.

Files added
- `index.html` — page markup
- `styles.css` — styling and color scheme
- `script.js` — carousel sync logic

Notes / Next steps
- Replace `content-wrap::before` background image URL with your map/logo file in `images/` to match the provided artwork.
- I kept the implementation simple and dependency-free. If you'd like animated easing, accessibility enhancements, or deep linking to sections (URL hash), I can add those next.
